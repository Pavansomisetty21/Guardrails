# What is Guardrails?
Guardrails is a Python framework that helps build reliable AI applications by performing two key functions:

1.Guardrails runs Input/Output Guards in your application that detect, quantify and mitigate the presence of specific types of risks. To look at the full suite of risks, check out [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/).

2.Guardrails help you generate structured data from LLMs.

Guardrails Hub is a collection of pre-built measures of specific types of risks (called 'validators'). Multiple validators can be combined together into Input and Output Guards that intercept the inputs and outputs of LLMs
